/// A type that can protect a referenced object from reclamation.

/// Protects up to a single address from concurrent reclamation in the referenced [`Domain`].
///
/// A hazard pointer does nothing when initially constructed. You need to load the pointer stored
/// by an [`std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr`](AtomicPtr) through it with [`HazardPointer::protect`] in
/// order for it to protect an object. That protection is tied to the exclusive (`&mut`) borrow of
/// the `HazardPointer` that `protect` takes; the moment the exclusive borrow ends (such as when
/// the `HazardPointer` is dropped), the protection ends.
///
/// Note that a hazard pointer can only protect an object if any call to `retire` for said object
/// happens in the same domain as the one the hazard pointer was created in. The generic argument
/// `F` is a _domain family_, which helps enforce that statically. Families are discussed in the
/// documentation for [`Domain`]. `F` defaults to the [global domain](Global).
///
/// If you want a (slightly) higher-level interface, use [`AtomicPtr`].
///
/// If you need to protect multiple referenced objects at the same time, use
/// [`HazardPointerArray`].
