//! Dynamic memory management for lock-free data structures.
//!
//! This library implements the [_hazard pointer memory reclamation mechanism_][hazptr],
//! specifically as proposed for the [C++ Concurrency Technical Specification][cts]. It is adapted
//! from the [implementation][folly-hazptr] found in Facebook's [Folly library][folly]. The initial
//! phases of implementation were all [live streamed].
//!
//! At a high level, hazard pointers provide a mechanism that allows readers of shared pointers to
//! prevent concurrent reclamation of the pointed-to objects by concurrent writers for as long as
//! the read operation is ongoing. When a writer removes an object from a data structure, it
//! instructs the hazard pointer library that said object is no longer reachable (that it is
//! _retired_), and that the library should eventually drop said object (_reclaim_ it) once it is
//! safe to do so. Readers, meanwhile, inform the library any time they wish to read through a
//! pointer shared with writers. Internally, the library notes down the address that was read in
//! such a way that it can ensure that if the pointed-to object is retired while the reader still
//! has access to it, it is not reclaimed. Only once the reader no longer has access to the read
//! pointer does the library allow the object to be reclaimed.
//!
//! TODO: Can also help with the ABA problem (ensure object isn't reused until there are no
//! pointers to it, so cannot "see" A again until there are no As left).
//!
//! For an overview of concurrent garbage collection with hazard pointers, see "_[Fearless
//! concurrency with hazard pointers]_". Aaron Turon post on "_[Lock-freedom without garbage
//! collection]_" which discusses the alternate approach of using epoch-based reclamation (see
//! below) is also a good reference.
//!

//!
//! // All reads must happen through a hazard pointer, so make one of those:
//! let mut h = HazardPointer::new();
//!
//! // We can now use the hazard pointer to read from the pointer without
//! // worrying about it being deallocated while we read.
//! let my_x = x.safe_load(&mut h).expect("not null");
//! assert_eq!(*my_x, 42);
//!
//! // We can willingly give up the guard to allow writers to reclaim the Box.
//! h.reset_protection();
//! // Doing so invalidates the reference we got from .load:
//! // let _ = *my_x; // won't compile
//!
//! // Hazard pointers can be re-used across multiple reads.
//! let my_x = x.safe_load(&mut h).expect("not null");
//! assert_eq!(*my_x, 42);

//! // Dropping the hazard pointer releases our guard on the Box.

//! // And it also invalidates the reference we got from .load:
//! // let _ = *my_x; // won't compile
//!
//! // Multiple readers can access a value at once:
//!
//! let mut h = HazardPointer::new();

//!
//! let mut h_tmp = HazardPointer::new();
//! let _ = x.safe_load(&mut h_tmp).expect("not null");

//!
//! // Writers can replace the value, but doing so won't reclaim the old Box.
//! let old = x.swap(Box::new(9001)).expect("not null");
//!
//! // New readers will see the new value:
//! let mut h2 = HazardPointer::new();
//! let my_x2 = x.safe_load(&mut h2).expect("not null");
//! assert_eq!(*my_x2, 9001);
//!
//! // And old readers can still access the old value:
//! assert_eq!(*my_x, 42);
//!
//! // The writer can retire the value old readers are seeing.
//! //
//! // Safety: this value has not been retired before.
//! unsafe { old.retire() };
//!
//! // Reads will continue to work fine, as they're guarded by the hazard.
//! assert_eq!(*my_x, 42);
//!
//! // Even if the writer actively tries to reclaim retired objects, the hazard makes readers safe.
//! let n = Domain::global().eager_reclaim();
//! assert_eq!(n, 0);
//! assert_eq!(*my_x, 42);
//!
//! // Only once the last hazard guarding the old value goes away will the value be reclaimed.

/// A managed pointer type which can be safely shared between threads.
///
/// This type has the same in-memory representation as a [`std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr`], but
/// provides additional functionality and stricter guarantees:
///
/// - `haphazard::AtomicPtr` can safely load `&T` directly, and ensure that the referenced `T` is
///   not deallocated until the `&T` is dropped, even in the presence of concurrent writers.
/// - All loads and stores on this type use `Acquire` and `Release` semantics.
///
/// **Note:** This type is only available on platforms that support atomic loads and stores of
/// pointers. Its size depends on the target pointerâ€™s size.
///
/// # Basic usage
///
/// To construct one, use [`AtomicPtr::from`]:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use haphazard::AtomicPtr;
/// let ptr: AtomicPtr<usize> = AtomicPtr::from(Box::new(42));
///
/// // Remember to retire the item stored in the AtomicPtr when it's dropped
/// // (assuming of course that the pointer is not also shared elsewhere):
/// unsafe { ptr.retire(); }
/// ```
///
/// Note the explicit use of `AtomicPtr<usize>`, which is needed to get the default values for the
/// generic arguments `F` and `P`, the domain family and pointer types of the stored values.
/// Families are discussed in the documentation for [`Domain`]. The pointer type `P`, which must
/// implement [`raw::Pointer`], is the type originaly used to produce the stored pointer. This is
/// used to ensure that when writers drop a value, it is dropped using the appropriate `Drop`
/// implementation.
///
/// **Warning:** When this type is dropped, it does _not_ automatically retire the object it is
/// currently pointing to. In order to retire (and eventually reclaim) that object, use
/// [`AtomicPtr::retire`] or [`AtomicPtr::retire_in`].
///
// The unsafe constract enforced throughout this crate is that a given `AtomicPtr<T, F, P>` only
// ever holds the address of a valid `T` allocated through `P` from a domain with family `F`, or
// `null`. This generally means that there are a fair few safety constraints on _writes_ to an
// `AtomicPtr`, but very few safety constraints on _reads_. This is intentional, with the
// assumption being that most consumers will read in more places than they write.
//
// Also, when working with this code, keep in mind that `AtomicPtr<T>` does not _own_ its `T`. It
// is entirely possible for an application to have multiple `AtomicPtr<T>` that all point to the
// _same_ `T`. This is why most of the safety docs refer to "load from any AtomicPtr".
